# Security Issues and Required Fixes

## Critical Security Issue Identified

**Problem**: The invitations system is accessible without authentication. Users can access `/invitations` without being logged in.

**Impact**: This is a serious security vulnerability that could allow unauthorized users to invite others to the system.

## Required Fix

Add authentication checks to all routes that should only be accessible to logged-in users, particularly the invitations system.

## Implementation Plan

1. Add `before_action :authenticate_user!` to controllers that require authentication
2. Ensure all invitation-related routes are protected
3. Test that unauthorized access is properly blocked

## Specific Changes Needed

### 1. Application Controller
Add authentication helper methods:
```ruby
def user_signed_in?
  @current_user.present?
end

def current_user
  @current_user
end

def authenticate_user!
  redirect_to root_path, alert: 'Please sign in to access this page.' unless user_signed_in?
end
```

### 2. Invitations Controller
Add authentication check:
```ruby
before_action :authenticate_user!
```

### 3. Other Controllers
Add `before_action :authenticate_user!` to any controllers that should only be accessible to authenticated users.

## Testing
After implementing these changes, verify that:
1. Unauthenticated users cannot access `/invitations`
2. Authenticated users can access the invitations system
3. Proper error messages are displayed for unauthorized access
