# FutSim - Football Simulator Development Log

## Project Overview
FutSim is a Ruby on Rails 8 application for simulating football (soccer) matches and managing teams, players, and leagues. The application allows users to create teams, manage player rosters, simulate matches, and track statistics.

## Development Progress

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Containerization (Completed)
- Created Rails 8 application with Ruby 3.4.4
- Configured Docker and Docker Compose for development environment
- Set up PostgreSQL database and Redis services
- Configured Tailwind CSS for styling
- Verified containerized development environment

### Phase 2: Authentication System Implementation (Completed)
#### OAuth Integration
- Integrated Google OAuth 2.0 for user authentication
- Configured OmniAuth with Google OAuth2 strategy
- Implemented secure OAuth flow with proper error handling
- Added CSRF protection and security measures

#### Invitation-Based Access Control
- Implemented invitation system for controlled access
- Created User model with invitation tokens and expiration
- Developed invitation management interface for administrators
- Built session management with proper sign-in/sign-out functionality

#### Key Features Implemented
1. **User Authentication Flow**:
   - Users sign in with Google OAuth
   - System checks for valid invitation before granting access
   - Session creation and management

2. **Invitation Management**:
   - Administrative interface for inviting users
   - Invitation tracking and revocation
   - Email-based invitations (to be extended with email delivery)

3. **Security Measures**:
   - CSRF protection for OAuth flows
   - Secure token generation for invitations
   - Proper session handling

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Core Components
- **Ruby 3.4.4** with **Rails 8.0.2.1**
- **PostgreSQL** for data persistence
- **Redis** for caching and background jobs
- **Docker** containerization for consistent environments
- **OmniAuth** with **Google OAuth2** strategy
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive UI design

#### Key Files and Components
1. **User Model** (`app/models/user.rb`):
   - OAuth integration with Google
   - Invitation token management
   - Validation and security features

2. **Authentication Controllers**:
   - Sessions controller for OAuth callbacks
   - Invitations controller for user management

3. **Docker Configuration**:
   - Development Dockerfile with proper gem caching
   - Docker Compose with PostgreSQL, Redis, and Rails services
   - Environment variable management for OAuth credentials

4. **Frontend Implementation**:
   - Tailwind CSS styling
   - Responsive navigation and UI components
   - OAuth button integration with proper Turbo handling

#### Completed Features
- ✅ OAuth 2.0 authentication with Google
- ✅ Invitation-based access control system
- ✅ User management interface
- ✅ Session management and security
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Database setup and migrations
- ✅ Responsive web interface

### Testing the Authentication Flow

1. **First User Invitation**:
   ```bash
   # In Rails console
   user = User.invite!('udo.schmidt.jr@gmail.com')
   ```

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000
   - Click "Sign in with Google"
   - Authenticate with Google account
   - Access granted for invited users

3. **Inviting New Users**:
   - Sign in as administrator
   - Navigate to /invitations
   - Enter email address and send invitation
   - Invited user can then authenticate

### Current Project Status
The authentication system is fully functional with OAuth integration and invitation-based access control. Users can be invited through the administrative interface, and invited users can authenticate with Google OAuth.

### Next Development Phases
1. Team management (create, edit, delete teams)
2. Player management (assign players to teams, manage player stats)
3. Match simulation engine
4. League/competition structure
5. Season management
6. Statistics tracking
7. Admin dashboard

## Development Environment
- Docker containers for isolated development
- Hot reloading for efficient development workflow
- PostgreSQL database with proper migrations
- Redis for caching and background jobs
